# Cardiovascular Disease Prediction Model - Jupyter Notebook

## Overview

This Jupyter Notebook serves as a cardiovascular disease (CVD) prediction model developed using Python and popular data analysis libraries such as Pandas, Numpy, and Seaborn. The model takes input data representing a patient's symptoms and utilizes the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm to predict whether the person is likely to have cardiovascular disease or not.

## Features

- **Input:** The notebook takes various symptoms of patients as input, such as age, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, etc.
- **Algorithm:** Utilizes the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm for prediction.
- **Libraries:** Built using Python and common data analysis libraries including Pandas, Numpy, and Seaborn.
- **Visualization:** Seaborn is used for data visualization, providing insights into the dataset and model performance.
